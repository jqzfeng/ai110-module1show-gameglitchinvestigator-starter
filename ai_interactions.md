# AI Interactions Log

> **Stretch features only.** Only fill in the sections that apply to stretch features you attempted. If you did not attempt a stretch feature, leave its section blank or delete it. This file is not required for the core project.

## Agent Workflow (SF8)

> Document your experience using an AI agent (e.g., Cursor Agent, Claude, Copilot) to make multi-step changes autonomously.

**What task did you give the agent?**

<!-- Describe the goal you asked the agent to accomplish -->

**What did the agent do?**

<!-- List the steps the agent took (files edited, commands run, etc.) -->

**What did you have to verify or fix manually?**

<!-- Describe anything the agent got wrong or that required human review -->

## Test Generation (SF7)

> Document how you used AI to help generate or improve tests.

| Edge Case | Prompt Used | AI-Suggested Test | Did It Pass? | Your Reasoning |

Prompt used to generate edge cases:
identify three potential "edge case" inputs (e.g., negative numbers, decimals, or extremely large values) that might still break your game. then, generate a suite of pytest cases that verify your game handles these inputs gracefully.

Edge Case 1: Negative numbers (e.g. -5). Why choose it: Usually people only guess positive numbers, the game logistics might not recognize '-' as negative sign and misread it as a string.
Edge Case 2: Decimal inputs (e.g. 50.9) Why choose it: Not sure if the logistics can read demical numbers as a whole or not, and wether it can convert them safely into an integer.
Edge Case 3: Extremely large values (e.g. 999999999999999). Why choose it: to see if it can handle larger numbers without crashing the game.

## Linting & Style (SF9)

> Document your use of AI for linting or code style improvements.

**Prompt used:**

```
<!-- Paste the prompt you gave the AI -->
```

**Linting output before:**

```
<!-- Paste relevant linter warnings/errors -->
```

**Changes applied:**

<!-- Describe what you changed based on the AI's suggestions -->

---

## Model Comparison (SF11)

> Compare two AI models on the same task.

**Task given to both models:**

<!-- Describe what you asked each model to do -->

| | Model A | Model B |
|-|---------|---------|
| **Model name** | | |
| **Response summary** | | |
| **More Pythonic?** | | |
| **Clearer explanation?** | | |

**Which did you prefer and why?**

<!-- Your conclusion -->
